                The Mental Healthcare Act 2017 has brought reformative changes to enhance the availability and scope
                of Mental Health services in the Country. In view of the fact that a large part of the population
                i.e. nearly 10-20 million Indians are currently suffering from complex mental disorders, such as
                schizophrenia and bipolar disorder and nearly 50 million Indians are suffering from mental illness
                like depression and anxiety, MentDoc was conceptualised with the goal to support the mandate of the
                Mental Healthcare Act 2017 for provisions of maintenance of records and reporting by Mental Health
                Professionals, and the right of the patient to assess basic medical records “a person with mental
                illness is entitled to receive documented medical information, pertaining to his diagnosis,
                investigation, assessment, and treatment as per the medical record”. MentDoc was initiated as
                India’s 1stElectronic Mental Health Record Solution, as well Practice Management & Patient
                Engagement Solution to assist mental health professionals in diagnosis, planning investigations,

                providing e-prescriptions, manage consultations, etc.

MentDoc was initiated as India’s 1stElectronic Mental Health Record Solution, as well Practice Management & Patient Engagement Solution to assist mental health professionals in diagnosis,
