                                With growing awareness of Mental Health and Mental Illnesses in India, the Mental Healthcare Bill was revised in 2017, bringing reformative changes to enhance the availability and scope of Mental Health services in the Country. To support the mandate of the Mental Healthcare Bill for provisions for maintenance of records and reporting by Mental Health Professionals, and the right of the patient to assess basic medical records (– a person with mental illness is entitled to receive documented medical information, pertaining to his diagnosis, investigation, assessment, and treatment as per the medical record), Ment Doc was initiated as India’s 1st Mental Health EHR (Electronic Health Record) Solution and Practice Management Solution to assist mental health professionals in diagnosis, planning investigations and treatment, recording, scheduling appointments, providing e-prescriptions, manage consultations, etc.
